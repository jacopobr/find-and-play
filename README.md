## Introduction 
'Find&Play' aims at providing a better experience with Turin's playground. Thanks to developed mobile application, parents will be able to find the playgrounds that best suites their needs: through a map, a complete list of all the equipment installed and a 360Â° panorama view of the playground, you will exactly know were you are going to spend you free time!
Furthermore, if problems araise, public administration can be directly contacted via the application. Thanks to their dedicated web platform, public administration members will be able to solve promptly all the reports made by the users.
